# Oh My ZSH (OMZ) Configuration

# Node and NVM Configuration

# FYI: Now sourced with the omz nvm plugin
# # Created by NVM, but could be made quicker following the comments here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/40798434
# export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
# [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
# [ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion
