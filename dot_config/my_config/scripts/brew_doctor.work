Warning: A newer Command Line Tools release is available.
Update them from Software Update in System Preferences or run:
  softwareupdate --all --install --force

If that doesn't show you any updates, run:
  sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
  sudo xcode-select --install

Alternatively, manually download them from:
  [4mhttps://developer.apple.com/download/all/[24m.
You should download the Command Line Tools for Xcode 11.3.1.


Warning: "config" scripts exist outside your system or Homebrew directories.
`./configure` scripts often look for *-config scripts to determine if
software packages are installed, and which additional flags to use when
compiling and linking.

Having additional scripts in your path can confuse software installed via
Homebrew if the config script overrides a system or Homebrew-provided
script of the same name. We found the following "config" scripts:
  /Users/kyleking/.asdf/shims/python3.7-config
  /Users/kyleking/.asdf/shims/python3.7m-config
  /Users/kyleking/.asdf/shims/python3.9-config
  /Users/kyleking/.asdf/shims/python-config
  /Users/kyleking/.asdf/shims/python3-config
  /Users/kyleking/.local/bin/pylint-config

Warning: Found Ruby file outside caarlos0/tap tap formula directory.

Warning: You are using macOS 10.14.
We (and Apple) do not provide support for this old version.
You will encounter build failures with some formulae.
Please create pull requests instead of asking for help on Homebrew's GitHub,
Twitter or any other official channels. You are responsible for resolving
any issues you experience while you are running this
old version.
