Warning: "config" scripts exist outside your system or Homebrew directories.
`./configure` scripts often look for *-config scripts to determine if
software packages are installed, and which additional flags to use when
compiling and linking.

Having additional scripts in your path can confuse software installed via
Homebrew if the config script overrides a system or Homebrew-provided
script of the same name. We found the following "config" scripts:
  /Users/kyleking/.asdf/shims/python3.7-config
  /Users/kyleking/.asdf/shims/python3.10-config
  /Users/kyleking/.asdf/shims/python3.7m-config
  /Users/kyleking/.asdf/shims/python3.9-config
  /Users/kyleking/.asdf/shims/python-config
  /Users/kyleking/.asdf/shims/python3-config
  /Users/kyleking/.asdf/shims/pylint-config
  /Users/kyleking/.local/bin/pylint-config

Warning: Homebrew's "sbin" was not found in your PATH but you have installed
formulae that put executables in /opt/homebrew/sbin.
Consider setting your PATH for example like so:
  echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/sbin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
