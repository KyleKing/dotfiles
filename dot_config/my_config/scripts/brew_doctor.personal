Warning: Unknown support status

Warning: A newer Command Line Tools release is available.
Update them from Software Update in System Preferences or run:
  softwareupdate --all --install --force

If that doesn't show you any updates, run:
  sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
  sudo xcode-select --install

Alternatively, manually download them from:
  [4mhttps://developer.apple.com/download/all/[24m.
You should download the Command Line Tools for Xcode 12.4.


Warning: "config" scripts exist outside your system or Homebrew directories.
`./configure` scripts often look for *-config scripts to determine if
software packages are installed, and which additional flags to use when
compiling and linking.

Having additional scripts in your path can confuse software installed via
Homebrew if the config script overrides a system or Homebrew-provided
script of the same name. We found the following "config" scripts:
  /Users/kyleking/.asdf/shims/python3.7-config
  /Users/kyleking/.asdf/shims/python3.10-config
  /Users/kyleking/.asdf/shims/python3.7m-config
  /Users/kyleking/.asdf/shims/python3.9-config
  /Users/kyleking/.asdf/shims/python-config
  /Users/kyleking/.asdf/shims/python3-config
  /Users/kyleking/.asdf/shims/python3.8-config

Warning: You have unlinked kegs in your Cellar.
Leaving kegs unlinked can lead to build-trouble and cause formulae that depend on
those kegs to fail to run properly once built. Run `brew link` on these:
